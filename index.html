# curlpipesh.me

A website that's also a valid shell script.

## How does it work?

At the very top of the file is the basic prelude:

  #!/usr/bin/env bash #<!--

By having this at the very top, we let the OS know that it's a shell script and
that it should be run in bash. This is immediately followed by an HTML comment
to prevent the next lines from printing:

  cat >/dev/null <<EOF
  #-->

cat(1) is used here to just consume the entire page to bash trying to parse all
the HTML and dying. At the end of the page, we start another HTML commend and
then stop the consuming cat(1):

  <!--
  E​O​F

And once we've done that, we're inside an HTML commend and can just write
whatever we want without it rendering in the browser!

Finally, we end it out with a bash-commented HTML comment end:

  #-​-​>

This ensures that the page is both well-formed HTML *and* a valid shell script.

## But shouldn't the shebang render?

It should! In fact, it actually does render! This is just hidden behind a div
that covers the entire page with a white background ^^;

## But how do you have E​O​F and <​!​-​- rendering in this? Shouldn't they get
   parsed too?

They should! But look closely -- those aren't the symbols you think they are!
If you use a font with ligatures, it might even be lying to you. There's
zero-width spaces between each character of the "dangerous" tokens to prevent
them from being consumed. The specific character used is "​" U+200B Zero Width
Space. See https://unicode-table.com/en/200B/ for more info.
